  },
  {
    question: "Do I get a discount if I purchase more than one course?",
    answer: `Our current rate is excellent, particularly given the number of units offered in each subject, the substantive content contained in each, and the fact that qualified teachers lead each lesson. Grade-level subjects range from 35 to 55 units at a rate of $50 USD. Our aim is to ensure that our fees are within the reach of working families. However, we will provide a discounted price for a grade-level bundle (four core subjects) once the core subjects for each grade level are available. Please visit Yak's Café for updates.`,

    question: "Do you provide refunds if I do not like a course?",
    answer:
      "Yes, however, there is a one- week deadline for requests after a course is purchased.This is done in order to prevent scenarios in which a course is bought, swiftly completed, and a refund requested",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I access a course as often as I wish?",
    answer: `Yes, you can. You are also given course access for one year after you've purchased it. 
Who should register for the course? Myself or my child?
Our policy requires parents or guardians to register a youngster under the age of 14 in order to guarantee adult supervision. Students who are 14 and older can self-register. However, we strongly recommend adult monitoring of student progress regardless of the student's age.

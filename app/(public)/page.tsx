                {`Amongst my fondest memories of early childhood (other than those things little boys do that we're not supposed to), are the occasions when my mother read bedside stories to me . . . tales of mesmerizing adventures told to a young mind who was absolutely certain that each word was true! After all these years, I can still picture the three bears coming home to find an unwanted visitor who'd helped herself to their bowls of delicious porridge! I can still picture the three little pigs building their homes and the big bad wolf threatening, ‚ÄúI'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house down!‚Äù`}
